# Instruction for Editting and Generating the PDF file

It was initially created with [Inkscape 1.1](https://inkscape.org/).

1. For each page, move the page to the frame for the A4 landscape, and then save it as *.svg (ex. AppleMetalCheatSheetPage01.pdf).

2. Concatenate all the pages with Preview. Open the pdf for the first page, open the thumbnail pane, and drag & drop all the other pdfs for all the other pages.

# Happy programming with Metal!
